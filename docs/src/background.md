In this section, we give a high-level overview of the theory behind the three models that are implemented in `BladeAD`. 
When appropriate, we refer the reader to relevant papers for a more thorough explanation of the rotor aerodynamic theory. 
We also explain the conventions used in `BladeAD` and summarize relevant features of the code base.
